Yamler - Making YAML easy and fun to use with Ruby
=========================================================================

Using YAML in Ruby is pretty easy, but I find myself doing several things
every time I use YAML. First is I always seem to pass it through ERB. The
other is that I want to pass it a binding, because I want to give it
access to some variables or methods. Finally I sometimes end up merging
several YAML files into one file, because other wise it would be too big
and unwieldy to manage. Enter Yamler:

=== Examples:
  # Renders said file through ERB, and then through YAML.load:
  Yamler.load('/path/to/file.yml')

  # Does the same as above but makes a method called say_hi
  # available to the binding of the Yamler::Template instance.
  Yamler.load('/path/to/file.yml') do
    def say_hi
      'hi'
    end
  end
  
  # Renders said file through ERB, and then through YAML.load:
  Yamler.load('/path/to/file.yml', {:locals => {:username => 'markbates'}, :foo => :bar})
